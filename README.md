# Simple Recurrent Neural Networks with Keras

## Introduction

In this project, you will use Keras with TensorFlow as its backend to create a recurrent neural network model and train it to learn to perform addition of simple equations given in string format. You will learn to create synthetic data for this problem as well. By the end of this 2-hour long project, you will have created, trained, and evaluated a sequence to sequence RNN model in Keras. Computers are already pretty good at math, so this may seem like a trivial problem, but itâ€™s not! The interesting part here is that we will give the model string data and not numeric data to work with. This means that the model needs to infer the meaning of various characters from a sequence of text input and then learn addition from the given data!

## Key Concepts

Create, train and evaluate a recurrent neural network model.
Train a sequence to sequence recurrent net to be able to solve simple addition equations given in string format.
